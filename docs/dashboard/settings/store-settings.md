By default, carts are automatically removed seven days after the last update. However, you can change this setting in Commerce Manager.

1. Go to the **Settings > Store Settings** tab.
1. In the **Cart Expiration** field, enter a number between 1 to 365 corresponding to the number of days after which the cart expires.

The default setting is updated with the new value.
