## Variations and Options

You can create variations and options and assign them to products to build child products with those variations and options. Variations are reusable, and you can attach the same variation to any number of products. You can also create a link between the existing variation and a new product. For example, a shoe size variation has five options and the size variation is linked to two shoe products that inherit the property.

For more information about building child product in Commerce Manager using variations and options, see the [Assigning variations and building child products](../pcm-products/pcm-product-configuration.md#step-4---assigning-variations-and-building-child-products) section.

### Modifiers

Use modifiers to change the properties of child products that are inherited from a base product. With modifiers, you only need to have one base product with a variation attached to the product.

Modifiers attached to a variation option are applied to a base product to create child products. For example, instead of creating three base products for three different shirt colors, you can do the following:

1. Create a base product, *shirt*, with the variation, *color*, attached to it.
1. Create three options for the *color* variation.
1. Create a modifier for each option to change the properties of each child product. For example, attach a *description append* modifier to each option so that each child product has a different description based on the color of the child product.
1. Build the child products.

The following screenshot provides an example of a child product of *shirt* which has a specific description associated with it because of the *description append* modifier setting for the option *yellow*:

## Creating Variations, options, and modifiers to build child products

Do the following to create variations, options, and modifiers:

1. [Create variations](#creating-variations).
1. For each variation, create options.
1. For each option, [set modifiers](#adding-modifiers-to-options).

:::important

- If no modifier exists for an option and you build child products using that option, slug and SKU appends are autogenerated and appended to the slug and SKU of the child product.
- After updating variation, option, or modifiers, you must [rebuild the child products](../pcm-products/pcm-product-configuration.md#step-4---assigning-variations-and-building-child-products) for the product to apply the changes.

    :::important
    You cannot duplicate a modifier type and operation combination. However, you can add a different operation for the same modifier type. For example, you can only have one SKU builder modifier. However, you can add another SKU append modifier to the same option.
    :::

    1. Click **Save**.

    For more information about different modifiers, the values,  and how to use them, see the [modifier types](#adding-modifiers-types) section.

#### Adding modifiers types

Modifiers are applied to the child products that are built using the variations and options for which modifiers are created.

1. In the **Edit Modifiers** tab, add the required modifiers to an option from the following modifiers types and values:
    - In the **Modifier** field, if you select **SKU**, select one of the following operations and appropriate values:
