A catalog is a combination of hierarchies and a price book. The hierarchies determine which products appear in the catalog. Only the products that are associated with nodes in the selected hierarchies are included in the catalog. The price book contains the prices for each of the products in the catalog. For more information about catalogs in Product Content Management, see the [Catalogs](../../concepts/catalogs.md) section.

## Catalog Releases

When you publish a catalog, the active products in the hierarchies appear in a catalog release. A catalog release provides a snapshot of product information taken at the time of publication. You can have one or more catalog releases available in your store. If you have more than one catalog published for your store, use catalog rules to specify when to display each catalog.

If you make any changes to the hierarchies, the products in a hierarchy, or the price book, republish the affected catalogs to capture the changes. The changes do not appear in the store unless the catalog is published.
