If your store has more than one catalog and you want to manage when certain catalogs are displayed, add catalog rules to control when a catalog is displayed. A catalog rule contains the catalog you want to set the rule for and how you want to display it in the storefront. For example, you can display different catalogs based on how a shopper accesses your store, such as through a mobile app or a web storefront. You can also display different catalogs to different shoppers and define custom criteria by creating tags. With tags, you can create region-specific tags so that the catalog displays only in the specified regions.

If you only have one catalog for all customers and channels, you need not set a catalog rule. If a catalog rule has no criteria defined, it is the default catalog rule.

## Creating catalog rules

1. In the **Product Content Management > Catalogs** page, click the **Rules** tab.
1. Click **Add Rule**.
1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the rule without any spaces.
1. (Optional) In the **Description** field, enter a description for the rule.
1. In the **Catalog** field, select a catalog that you want to set the rule for.
1. (Optional) In the **Customer** field, select the email address of the customers eligible to view the catalog.
    If you leave this field empty, all customers can view the catalog.
1. (Optional) In the **Channels** field, enter the channels in which this catalog can be displayed.

    The channel that matches the channel specified in a catalog displays that catalog in the storefront. If you leave this field empty, all channels display the catalog. Ensure that you press enter after typing each channel name.

1. (Optional) To further restrict the eligibility criteria for this rule, in the **Tags** field, enter user-defined tag.
1. Click **Save**.

### Next step
