You can get started quickly with Elastic Path Commerce Cloud by taking advantage of a Commerce Cloud reference experience store, or you can create your own storefront.

View and interact with the reference experiences stores live at the following locations:

- [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud React reference storefront](https://epcc-reference.elasticpath.com/)
- [Shopkit reference experience in a web page](https://embedded-commerce.elasticpath.com/)

To start developing your own content from one of the reference experience stores, follow the instructions:

- [Reference storefront](reference-storefront.md)
- [Shopkit](shopkit-demo.md)
