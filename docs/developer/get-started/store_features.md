The React PWA Reference Storefront implements a selection of Elastic Path Commerce Cloud features. You can modify the storefront to suit your needs.

* Themes

Customizable storefront themes allow you to brand your stores with custom fonts, colors, images, and more.

* Search features (powered by Algolia/Coveo)

Search functionality includes search facets, sorting, and filtering. It is powered by third-party tools such as Algolia and Coveo. Algolia includes voice-enabled search.

* Category Navigation

The store catalog includes sample data organized into categories, and features include nested sub-category navigation of your store. In your store, you can create as many categories as you need. Shoppers who are browsing for a product can either use the navigation bar or enter a category name in the search field.

* Localization and currencies

The storefront supports multiple languages, locales, and currencies. By default, English and French locales are included and you can easily create additional locales.

* Customer Accounts

Guest and registered check-out functionality is enabled. Shoppers have the option to register or log in to a customer account. From the account, shoppers can manage their profile and address information and view their purchase history.

* Compare Products

Each product features a **compare** check box. Shoppers can select products to compare and view the items by clicking the Compare button, which is available throughout the store.

* Feature a Product

You can also feature a product on the front page so that users are presented with it when they arrive at your store.

* Custom Footer / Social Media sharing

The default footer contains company information and social media links. Customize the footer to reflect your organization.

* Cart

Shoppers can easily view their cart, which rolls in from the right-hand edge of the screen.

* Promotions and Promotion Codes

Enable promotions and coupon codes for products in your store and feature them in the storefront. Promotions can either be automatically applied or triggered by a coupon code at checkout.

* Order History

You can use the order history feature in your storefront to add items to your cart from a previous order.

* Multiple carts and cart persistence

Multiple carts provides shoppers the flexibility to create and save multiple carts with complex orders. You donâ€™t have to complete one order before starting another cart. Each cart is separate so updates to one cart do not affect other carts.

* Bulk order and quick order

You can add multiple SKUs and their quantities into a cart. You can use quick add forms to do so.
