If you have followed the storefront quick start process successfully, you can now view and move through the core shopping journey in your store. As you continue to build your store and add integrations, you can use the branded storefront to validate your work. If you want to roll out this storefront to your customers, continue enhancing it. Alternatively, or in parallel, you can start development on a production storefront that you build yourself or create with a third party.

For more information on store and storefront development, see your Elastic Path sales representative, and the resources available at the [Elastic Path web site](https://www.elasticpath.com/).
