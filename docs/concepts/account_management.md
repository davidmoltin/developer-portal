In the Elastic Path Commerce Cloud store, sellers can create accounts and account members. Sellers can also assign the account members to accounts using account memberships. Associated account members can log in to the store and create orders for their accounts.

Each account can have multiple account members. Users associated with an account can transact on behalf of the account.
