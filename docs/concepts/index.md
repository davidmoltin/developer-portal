title: Elastic Path Commerce Cloud Introduction
sidebar_label: Overview

A successful store implementation relies on your knowledge of commerce concepts and how those concepts are implemented in Commerce Cloud. Store administrators, developers, and users can all benefit from reviewing the key concepts.

The key concepts serve as a launching pad into the rest of the documentation. Each key concept summarizes a concept and then links you to other related concepts, APIs, and how-to guides.

The concepts in this section build on one another, with the foundational concepts covered first. We recommend that you start by reading about [Security](security.md) and then browse through the remaining concepts.
