Products are the items or services that you offer for sale in your store catalog. Products have a name, description, stock-keeping unit (SKU), and unit price, and products can be physical or digital. While defining products, the products are in a draft state. Products often have additional information attached to them, such as an image of the product, inventory status, and product variations including sizes or colors. As a store administrator, when you are satisfied with the draft product information you enter, you can make the product live in your store catalog.

When you have products with variations, such as color or size, you can treat the variations as child products. Each child product can have its own description.

To make it easier for customers to find products in your catalog, you can group products by attributes. You can use brands, collections, and categories to create the groups. For example, a running shoe might be part of both a brand (such as Nike) and a collection (such as Summer). You can also show customers products that are related to the product they are viewing.

If the store supports multiple languages, you can localize product names and descriptions. If the store support multiple currencies, the unit price can be an array of prices for the currencies used in the store.
