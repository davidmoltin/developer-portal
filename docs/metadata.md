# Metadata

## Change the website metadata

Metadata is stored in the `siteConfig.yaml` file.
Make this uniquely yours.

```yaml
meta:
  title: Elastic Path Developer Portal
  description: Everything you ever wanted to know about Elastic Path Commerce Cloud
  siteUrl: https://elasticpath.redoc.ly
```

The title is used within the html title tag.

:::attention Note:

It may require a `yarn clean` for that to update in the development environment.
